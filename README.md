The goal of this app is to see how to integrate a traditionally built business logic using closure in Javascript.  
Then to integrate it with a framework state-management system. 

More often than not frontend logic is based off of framework state management logic.

My goal is to try and see if it's possible to decouple the two. 

Or to find out that it's not worth it in the place.

To run the app:

`pnpm run dev`

To run tests:

`pnpm run test`


This app uses
